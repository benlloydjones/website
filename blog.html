        <p>A beginning in Javascript (for the course at least). New things straight away, which was surprising and good: using 'let' and 'const' rather than the ubiquitous 'var' is great. A hugely accomplished feeling after yesterday's homework and a sense that I'll see these guys:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>.map()</li>
            <li>.reduce()</li>
            <li>.filter()</li>
            <li>.forEach()</li>
          </ul>
        <p>again, and again, and again.</p>

        <p>Getting to grips with CSS isn't straight forward, I find it difficult and a fiddle and not very satisfying. I am sure it will become easier as I use it more. Learning about how to use CSS to make responsive websites was quite excellent and seeing small changes in the stylesheet relating to big chages on the screen was satisfying. If I keep at it I am sure it will become more straight forward.</p>

        <h3>15 August 2017</h3>
        <p>Today was lots of work on HTML. While most of it was going over things I was pretty familiar with already, the details on forms were interesting and new. Something I look to implement on this website, as part of the contact section as soon as I learn to do anything more than have them just collect information.</p>
        <p>Additionally I learnt about the three excellent things. The first two, <a href="https://www.fillmurray.com/">FillMurray</a> and <a href="https://www.placecage.com/">PlaceCage</a> are both fun and I'm sure will be useful in the future. The bigger a-ha moment was the realisation I should have been making my small CSS tweaks in my browser's dev tools. I felt like a fool thinking of the huge amount of time I've spent making things looking just right, flicking between a style sheet and refreshing a browser. No more. Happy day.</p>

        <p>A first day, a lot of installing software, a lot of new people. Everyone seems friendly, lots of getting to grip with new tools. Learning the terminal brings back days of using the command line in DOS, which was a long time ago. Looking forward to really getting to grips with some of the power in Atom. Tomorrow brings on HTML. I'm hoping that it shouldn't present anything that's too new.</p>

  			<p>Excitement, trepidation, hope. this is how I feel, the day before my meeting my cohort at General Assembly for the first time tomorrow. I guess I'll have more to update tomorrow afternoon.</p>
