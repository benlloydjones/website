        <p>A small update but a very big lesson. Don't feel bad if you don't have the best solution to a problem, learn form the person who does and be better next time.</p>

        <p>We had to solve a lot of problems using javascript as part of our homework this weekend. It was really fun going through each of them and wrestling with the steps I had to take to get from start to end of each function. My greatest frustration came from the .unshift() array method. I couldn't work out why I couldn't chain a .join() to it after I had inserted somthing at the beginning of my array. It just didn't make any sense. I resorted to spliting the steps out and putting them together one by one until they broke and then leaving it at the last step. Puzzling over what I was doing wrong. It turned out what I had done wrong was not read the documentation of the .unshift() method properly and realise that it didn't return the new array with it's new entry but instead returned its new length. Hopefully lesson learned: <strong>Read The Fucking Manual</strong>.</p>

        <p>A beginning in Javascript (for the course at least). New things straight away, which was surprising and good: using 'let' and 'const' rather than the ubiquitous 'var' is great. A hugely accomplished feeling after yesterday's homework and a sense that I'll see these guys:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>.map()</li>
            <li>.reduce()</li>
            <li>.filter()</li>
            <li>.forEach()</li>
          </ul>
        <p>again, and again, and again.</p>

        <p>Getting to grips with CSS isn't straight forward, I find it difficult and a fiddle and not very satisfying. I am sure it will become easier as I use it more. Learning about how to use CSS to make responsive websites was quite excellent and seeing small changes in the stylesheet relating to big chages on the screen was satisfying. If I keep at it I am sure it will become more straight forward.</p>

        <p>Today was lots of work on HTML. While most of it was going over things I was pretty familiar with already, the details on forms were interesting and new. Something I look to implement on this website, as part of the contact section as soon as I learn to do anything more than have them just collect information.</p>
        <p>Additionally I learnt about the three excellent things. The first two, <a href="https://www.fillmurray.com/">FillMurray</a> and <a href="https://www.placecage.com/">PlaceCage</a> are both fun and I'm sure will be useful in the future. The bigger a-ha moment was the realisation I should have been making my small CSS tweaks in my browser's dev tools. I felt like a fool thinking of the huge amount of time I've spent making things looking just right, flicking between a style sheet and refreshing a browser. No more. Happy day.</p>

        <p>A first day, a lot of installing software, a lot of new people. Everyone seems friendly, lots of getting to grip with new tools. Learning the terminal brings back days of using the command line in DOS, which was a long time ago. Looking forward to really getting to grips with some of the power in Atom. Tomorrow brings on HTML. I'm hoping that it shouldn't present anything that's too new.</p>

  			<p>Excitement, trepidation, hope. this is how I feel, the day before my meeting my cohort at General Assembly for the first time tomorrow. I guess I'll have more to update tomorrow afternoon.</p>
